## The Most Famous Roasters in Melbourne?
![blog placeholder](./map.webp)
Melbourne is synonymous with coffee culture, right? I looked up Patricia Roasters in Melbourne CBD. Over 4,000 reviews and a 4.6 rating on Google Map! Had to check it out.

It's tucked away in a back alley, but even at 10am on a weekday it was packed, mostly with people from nearby offices (presumably). Luckily the line moved pretty quickly.

The inside is pretty small like this. You can feel how busy it is just from the camera shake! lol

We ordered a latte and a flat white, but both ended up being categorized under White Coffee. Looking at the menu, there are exactly three options: White / Black / Filter. Prices are reasonable too.
We also had to choose the coffee bean,  Santa Isabel or Mountain Coffee, so we picked one each. 
One thing that stood out: even though it was insanely busy, the staff taking orders was incredibly calm and attentive. Even with a long line, they gave their full attention to each order. I could feel the professionalism in that attitude. Made me wonder how they could read ~~clients~~ customers so well.

It's essentially a standing cafe, so everyone drinks outside,  standing on the street or sitting on the curb. A back alley, next to a big yellow recycling bin, somehow becomes a full cultural experience here. We got takeaway cups, but you can also drink from proper cups.

Canelé! Everyone in the Google reviews get it, so we did. It's good.

Ordered this one just because it looked amazing. And it really was. 
It's a cinnamon bun, but instead of ground cinnamon powder, they use coarsely crushed cinnamon sticks. The soft bread with those chunky bits of cinnamon,  every bite releases this fresh, punchy cinnamon aroma. 
Looks like it comes from a bakery at the Victoria Market (saw the exact same thing there), but the pairing with the coffee is absolutely insane.

## It's Good
Honestly, I don't really know coffee. But this place was about the *experience* of drinking coffee.
A back alley with a recycling bin, sitting on the street in the middle of a buzzing crowd, eating a cinnamon bun with your coffee. It's Fun 😄.
