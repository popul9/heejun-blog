## Where even is Brunswick?
![blog placeholder](./brunswick-map.webp)
I only knew Melbourne, Brunswick was a completely new name to me. My wife told me about it (So thankful 🥹). Young artists, street art, coffee culture, basically the hipster spot. What's interesting is that it also has a strong Japanese culture vibe.
Got off at Brunswick station and started exploring along the railway line.

Just walking past the cafes here, the vibes were already something else. I wanted to check them all out, but I was set on Osoi so I kept moving.

Got really hungry on the way so grabbed some rice balls from a Japanese cafe. Simple but tasty as authentic.

## Arriving at Osoi

Trains passing by in front, peacefully hanging out. Some quiet music playing in the background.

Two people in front of us happened to run into each other and got talking. I (unintentionally) caught bits of their conversation. Both worked in theatre. One was bouncing between Brooklyn and here doing theatre work, and the other was an Australian actress saying the industry here is just so much smaller compared to the States, making it tough. Didn't catch everything, but the fact that conversations like this just happen naturally in this cafe... so cool lol. Wher AM I? 😆

It was aroud Lunar New Year, so I wrote my own wish too. "Please let me come back to this cafe often." lol
So grateful.
