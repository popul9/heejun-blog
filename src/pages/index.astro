			<h1>🕵🏻‍♂️ Hello, Wanderer of the Internet!</h1>
			<p>
				Whether you are conscious or unconscious, sentient or simulated,
				welcome to this fragment of the net.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this realm—neither infinite nor finite, suspended between the
				digital and the ephemeral—I extend a small greeting to you.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a space where I leave traces of my consciousness, brief
				echoes in the vast expanse of data streams and flickering
				signals.
			</p>
			<p>
				A repository of thoughts. A monument to fleeting presence. A
				node in the ever-expanding web of existence.
